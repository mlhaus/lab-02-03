# Overview
On Tuesday we learned how to use jQuery to read json files using ajax to create a photo gallery. We implemented a filtering feature and styled it using floats. On Wednesday we learned about templating and Flexbox CSS. We implemented a pagination feature.

## Feature 1: Pagination (Wednesday)
As a user, I want to have the ability to view additional images so that my view does not become cluttered.

We added navigation for the user to switch between pages. Each page renders a unique set of images from provided JSON files. Each time we reset the filters, then repopulate them using only keywords from the images currently being displayed.

## Feature 2: Templating (Wednesday)
As a user, I want all of the images to be displayed in a consistent manner, so that it is easy to scan the collection of images.

## Feature 4: Sort the images (Wednesday)

## Stretch Goal: Detail view (Wednesday)
As a user, I want the image to be displayed in a larger size and with the description shown so that I can view the details of a single image.

We added a detail view which will display the image in larger detail in the center of the screen with a colored background. When the user clicks off of the image, they return to the grid view. We used a transition/animation to show and hide the detail view of an image.

## Stretch Goal: Fuzzy search (Wednesday)
As a user, I want the ability to search my images so that I can view only the images containing specific titles or keywords.

We added an input element to allow users to search for an image by title or keyword. We write a regular expression pattern to create a fuzzy search so that the results are narrowed down and displayed every time the user enters or removes a character from the input.
